# AuraLizard-VRTK
Network Data Analysis final project about network data auralization. The project title "AuraLizard" is what you might get when "Auralization" runs through autocorrect.
The app is developed in the Unity game engine version 2020.3.30f1, in a project compatible with the open-source Virtual RealityToolkit VRTK (https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK), however this app is not currently designed for use in VR.

## Introduction
Data visualization is a useful initial tool to help humans intuit further questions. Visualization maps data parameters to visualattributes that human users can pick out when displayed on ascreen. Such methods utilize the spatial resolution of the humanoptical system and visual acuity for spotting patterns in brightness,colour, size, position, spacing, and shape. For example, a repeatingoscillation in a pressure-time graph can prompt a researcher toask questions that would not be obvious in the raw data. However,despite its unique features, the human auditory system is relativelyuntapped as a channel data analysis. Human hearing has a superiortemporal resolution to human vision and can monitor for changesoutside the focused field of view. We can hear patterns of volume,pitch, reverb, direction, vibrato, and timbre through sound. Studyingways to ’hear’ data will also drive better tools for the visuallyimpaired. For these reasons, this paper proposes to build a dataauralization application where nodes can make sounds in a userinteractive 3D space. We propose adding parametric sounds tonodes will make it easier for a user to intuit essential network information such as overall topology and degree distribution andask new questions about the data
